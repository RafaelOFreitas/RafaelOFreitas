### "What's up" \o/ 👋

🇧🇷  My name is Rafael Freitas and I'm from Brazil. 

👷  I work as a back-end developer. I actually work as a back-end engineer at ZUP.

🤔 I love challenges and saying that what was "impossible" was actually something complicated!

🌱 I'm currently learning a little about front-end and a lot about algorithm and machine learning.

👨‍🏫 Currently angel helping people who are interested in entering the software development area.
